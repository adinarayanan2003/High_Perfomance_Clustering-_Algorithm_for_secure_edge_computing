# High Perfomance Clustering Algorithm for secure edge computing

 In the context of edge computing, the performance of clustering algorithms plays a
critical role in managing and processing the vast amount of data generated by edge
devices. However, traditional clustering algorithms often struggle to handle the high-
dimensional and dynamic nature of this data, leading to suboptimal performance and
inefficiencies. This paper proposes a novel high-performance clustering algorithm
designed to overcome these challenges. The algorithm aims to improve the efficiency
and scalability of data processing in edge computing environments, thereby
enhancing overall system performance. While the primary focus is on the algorithm’s
performance, its potential contribution to improving security measures in edge
computing is also acknowledged.
